# rag-with-legal-docs
RAG pipeline with Legal Statutes (pdf format)

A powerful local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application that lets you chat with your PDF documents using Ollama and LangChain. This project is done on google colab. 

The documents I used are a combination of the THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT, 2005 and THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORKPLACE (PREVENTION, PROHIBITION AND REDRESSAL) ACT, 2013.
