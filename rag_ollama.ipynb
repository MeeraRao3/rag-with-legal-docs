This does not include any member of the family of the employer.\\n\\nHowever, there is no explicit definition of \"domestic violence\" in the Act.

This will be helpful if you decide to report the behavior.\\n3.  **Speak with HR (if available)**: If your company has an Human Resources department, reach out to them about the situation. They can provide guidance on how to handle the situation and may be able to intervene.\\n4.  **Talk to a trusted colleague or mentor**: Share your concerns with someone you trust who can offer support and advice. This could be a coworker, supervisor, or mentor outside of your organization.\\n5.  **Consider reporting the behavior**: If the behavior is making you uncomfortable or affecting your work, consider reporting it to HR or a higher-level manager. You can also file a complaint with your state's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n6.  **Focus on maintaining professional boundaries**: Maintain a professional relationship with your boss and colleagues. Avoid engaging in conversations that may be perceived as flirtatious or intimate.\\n7.  **Seek support outside of work**: If the situation is impacting your mental health, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor for guidance and support.\\n\\nYour well-being and career are important.
